    I've worked for corporations such as Bank of America where I have provided support to my business partners with their 
    banking information systems. I've also worked for telecommunications corporations, Vodafone Americas Inc and AT&T, where 
    I have provided IT support to many of my business partners. I've also worked for many dental companies and help achieve 
    their IT goals by enabling their business with the required IT infrastructure to help them achieve their business mission.

    I currently work at the leading Home Staging education company in the world, Staged Homes, as the Director of IT where I am 
    responsible for the IT operations and ensuring that our customers, our Accredited Staging Professionals, achieve their Home 
    Staging and business goals through the use of our systems. I was hired as a Network Administrator in 2006 to assist my business 
    partners with their network and computer problems. Today, my responsibilities are to develop web applications, manage our servers, 
    and essentially execute IT projects that achieve our organization's goals.
