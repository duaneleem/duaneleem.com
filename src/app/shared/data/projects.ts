                Founded in 1974 by veterans, Swords to Plowshares is a community-based not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization that 
                provides needs assessment and case management, employment and training, housing, and legal assistance to approximately 
                3,000 veterans in the San Francisco Bay Area each year.
            </p>
            
            <h5>My Work</h5>
            <p>
                I've re-engineered Swords-To-Plowshares.org to use the latest in Responsive Web Development and integrate
                WordPress as the main provider for our project stakeholders.  They now have the ability to update the website
                immediately by using the custom theme templates that were developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the programming work, I've delivered their application's infrastructure to use AWS platform and 
                CloudFlare to deliver their production-ready website.

                Our website needed a major upgrade.  Search engines started favoring websites that can adapt to all
                screen sizes.  My team and I redesigned the website so that it has an excellent view no matter what

                dependant on PHP, redesigned them, and completely reprogrammed the forms to use AngularJS / ExpressJS
                (REST API).

                the website this way so that the only time the back-end server is used is when someone actually
                submits an email.  The rest of the website processing is handled by GitHub pages and AWS S3.

            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>To help our Accredited Staging Professionals (ASP®), I've taken our spreadsheet calculator and reprogrammed it as a mobile application for both iOS and Android. This will give our ASP®'s a handy application they can use to calculator their Return on Staging Investment (ROSI®).</p>

            <p>The new version of the Home Staging Calculator is redeveloped using the Ionic Framework to make use of the built in support for Angular.</p>
